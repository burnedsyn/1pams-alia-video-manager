as in the past i came,  now i come again, 
a long road never really alone, never really in this world,
bridge and gateway between different realms you could just imagine
rooted in this earth, entangled in its history, 
sometimes following the path, sometimes creating it.
thousands of voices echoed through the ages of a millions lifes
Student following the path of a sacred knowledge, path finder with due respect to all the ancestors that leaded this path and ways
i have learned through many ages and experimented the path.
as each coin has two sides, so the path, for each a life to learn.
A fool walking his path, in a so called dark world, guardians of a secret flame, spark of this fire who stand as a sentinel.
A little grain of sand seemingly lost on a beach. silent witness of all those humanities that came and go through ages that even the rock can't remember
It's a war time now the choice is made take the road!
cheers to all alreday lost and thoses who will fall. A climax draws near, like an impending storm, they say.
It's time to don the armor and swear an oath to these words.


As in the past, I have come, and now I come again,
On a long road, never truly alone, never truly bound by this world,
bridge and gateway between different realms you could just imagine
Rooted in this earth, enmeshed in its history,
Sometimes following the path, sometimes creating it.

Student following the path of a sacred knowledge, path finder with due respect to all the ancestors that leaded this path and ways
i have learned through many ages and experimented the path.
as each coin has two sides, so the path, for each a life to learn.

A fool walking his path, in a so-called dark world,
Guardians of a secret flame, sparks of this fire, standing as sentinels.

A little grain of sand seemingly lost on a beach. silent witness of all those humanities that came and go through the ages that 
even the rock can't remember

Now, in times of war, the choice is made. Take the road!
Cheers to all already lost and those who will fall. A climax draws near, like an impending storm, they say.

It's time to don the armor and swear an oath to these words we cherish, to these words that are life itself.
the whom who is in charge, it is the quintessence of these words 
the spirit behind them who shape and sing them creating the ripples of creation

In the face of war, the call to action resounds,
To don the armor and stand tall, firm and proud.
An oath to uphold the values cherished and dear,
To protect the light, dispel darkness and fear.

In the midst of chaos and impending storm,
Warriors arise, their purpose to transform.
They march forward, their hearts steadfast and true,
Bound by a duty to fight for what is right and due.

Though the path may be perilous, fraught with strife,
Each step taken is a testament to life.
Through battles fought and sacrifices made,
A legacy is woven, in history's braid.

In the realm of shadows, where secrets lie,
The pathfinders tread, with discerning eye.
They seek knowledge, uncover mysteries untold,
Guided by wisdom, as ancient as gold.

And as the journey unfolds, the voices of the past,
Whisper wisdom, reminders that forever last.
The student of sacred knowledge, eager to learn,
Discovers truths, within each twist and turn.

Amidst the ebb and flow of humanity's tide,
A witness stands, a grain of sand, side by side.
Though seemingly small, its presence profound,
A testament to resilience, on solid ground.

So, let the trumpets sound and the drums resound,
As warriors assemble, their purpose unbound.
For in the face of darkness, they take their stand,
United in spirit, with oath in hand.
